1. Non-functional requirements  
    Itâ€™s important that our system also meets the following requirements:
    
    1. High availability: The system should be highly available. High availability requires a good percentage of uptime. Generally, an uptime of 99% and above is considered good.
    1. Scalability: As the number of users grows, these issues should not become bottlenecks: storage for uploading content, the bandwidth required for simultaneous viewing, and the number of concurrent user requests should not overwhelm our application/web server.
    1. Good performance: A smooth streaming experience leads to better performance overall.
    1. Reliability: Content uploaded to the system should not be lost or damaged.
